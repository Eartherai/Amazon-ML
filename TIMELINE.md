## 2026-09-25T00:46:46.247511+05:30 | Codex | Initialization
- Action: inspected complete workspace; read source documents and supplied code.
- Commands: rg --files; find student_resource; pypdf extraction; sysctl; df.
- Config: M5, 10 CPU cores, 24 GiB unified RAM, 24 GiB available disk.
- Result: seven TSVs, two PDFs, README, template, validator, original ZIP. No existing Git repo.
- Interpretation: research-first local processing feasible; all-pairs comparison infeasible; storage constrained.
- Next: install isolated tools, audit every source, document discrepancies.

## 2026-09-25T01:01:23.120469+05:30 | Codex | Phase-one evidence
- Action: full six-source/ground-truth audit, full positive-pair comparison, near-neighbor diagnostics, entity folds, metric/TSV tests; official Colab CLI installed and login verified.
- Commands: src.audit_data; src.audit_pairs; src.build_validation; pytest; colab usage; colab sessions.
- Config: 4 CPU workers, DuckDB 6 GB memory limit, folds seed 20260925.
- Result: 24,229,173 source records, 7,638,365 labeled links, zero shared target owners or cross-country positive links; 22 tests pass. Colab 0 units, no sessions. AWS saved session expired.
- Interpretation: large candidate pool; multi-match output and cross-script recall are essential. No model training or cloud spend.
- Repairs: audit attempts 001/002 hit reserved SQL alias names and were retained as failed logs; 003 completed. Unicode audit normalization was then corrected to preserve combining marks; authoritative audit is AUDIT-004/PAIR-002, older reports preserved. Colab 0.7.1 unavailable; PyPI 0.7.2 installed.
- Next: finalize report, transliteration probe and EXP-001 diagnostic.

## 2026-09-25T01:08:47.520574+05:30 | Codex | Research phase complete
- Action: measured exact baseline, generic transliteration sample and independent per-file memory; completed research, compute plan, roadmap and handoff prompt.
- Commands: src.exact_baseline --config configs/experiments/EXP-001.json; src.audit_supplement; src.audit_memory; colab usage; colab sessions.
- Config: dev fold 0, seed 20260925, full training target pool; non-ASCII positive probe n=10000; no fitting.
- Result: macro F0.5=0.08327203, precision=1.000000, recall=0.01314345, pairs=20075; Colab authenticated with 0 units and no sessions.
- Interpretation: exact matching is only a diagnostic; union retrieval and cross-script rescue have highest priority. Generic transliteration helps but does not solve all India noise.
- Next: EXP-002 lexical retrieval; AWS remains unused, learned training not started.

## 2026-09-25T01:12:50.224359+05:30 | Codex | Final research verification
- Action: integrated candidate-generation test and completed artifact consistency review.
- Commands: pytest; compileall; git diff --check; JSON/CSV and inventory assertions.
- Result: 23 tests passed; six independent parser row counts agree; split covers all 2,206,821 S1; label-integrity and forbidden-target checks pass; no leaderboard submissions; current data/pair/memory evidence preserved in Git.
- Interpretation: phase-one infrastructure and measured diagnostics are ready for the retrieval work. One-command research wrapper is supplied; its individual stages were verified, not redundantly rerun as a full wrapper.
- Next: EXP-002.
